Handlebar warning:
Error: Handlebars: Access has been denied to resolve the property "title" because it is not an "own property" of its parent.
TODO >> Check solution: https://handlebarsjs.com/api-reference/runtime-options.html#options-to-control-prototype-access
To avoid XSS attacks they changed some configuration.
My solution was: npm install handlebars@4.5.3 - older version of handlebars
since on the front end I will use react
